# Using Plotly to to Graph Belly Button Bacterial Species

## Overview of Project
The overall purpose of this project was to use a Plotly in JavaScript to graph bully button bacterial samples to 3 different graphs. We got
the data from a json file with personal information scrubbed from the data.

## Results
We were able to graph all of the information based on the ID of a person, and not their name. To do this, we orignally had a dropdown menu
where we can select any ID. That would then display a Demographic Info box, the Gauge chart for how many times the person shoulw clean 
their belly button, a Horizontal Bar Chart that displayed the top 10 bacteria found in each person, and the Bubble Chart showing the amount
of cultures per sample.

## Summary

At the end, we were supposed to use our HTML skills to change the look of the page. The three things I did were, give a background color,
add a brief description for each chart, and I moved the graphs around.
